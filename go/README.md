## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Or using Make
make deps
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure

```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up -d

# Setup storage and database
make setup
```

### 3. Run Basic Pipeline

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start worker
make run-worker

# Terminal 2: Start workflow
make run-starter
```

### 4. Run Resource-Optimized Pipeline (Advanced)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Workflow orchestration only
make run-workflow-worker

# Terminal 2: CPU-intensive activities
make run-cpu-worker

# Terminal 3: GPU-accelerated activities  
make run-gpu-worker

# Terminal 4: IO-intensive activities
make run-io-worker

# Terminal 5: Start resource-optimized workflow
make run-optimized-starter
```

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Basic Document Pipeline

Single worker handling all activities on the `document-processing` task queue:

- **File**: `workflows/document_pipeline.go`
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, small to medium workloads
- **Setup**: Single worker, simple configuration
- **Performance**: Good for <10K documents/day

### 2. Resource-Optimized Pipeline  

Multiple specialized workers with dedicated task queues:

- **File**: `workflows/resource_optimized.go`
- **Use Case**: Production, high-throughput workloads
- **Setup**: 4 workers (workflow, CPU, GPU, IO)
- **Performance**: Optimized for 100K+ documents/day

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Factor | Basic Pipeline | Resource-Optimized |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Setup Complexity | Simple (1 worker) | Complex (4 workers) |
| Resource Efficiency | Mixed workload | Optimized per type |
| Scalability | Vertical scaling | Horizontal scaling |
| Best For | Development, small scale | Production, high scale |

## Configuration

The application can be configured via environment variables:

### Temporal Configuration
```bash
TEMPORAL_HOST=localhost:7233
```

### Database Configuration
```bash
METADATA_DB_HOST=localhost
METADATA_DB_PORT=5433
METADATA_DB_NAME=document_metadata
METADATA_DB_USER=docuser
METADATA_DB_PASSWORD=docpass
```

### S3/MinIO Configuration
```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
S3_BUCKET=documents
```

### ChromaDB Configuration
```bash
VECTOR_DB_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### LLM Service Configuration
```bash
LLM_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081
USE_MOCK_SERVICES=true
```

### GPU Configuration (for GPU Worker)
```bash
GPU_COUNT=2
```

## Key Components

### Activities

#### Original Pipeline Activities

1. **IngestionActivities**
   - `ParseCSVActivity`: Reads document metadata from CSV
   - `DownloadAndValidateBatch`: Downloads documents in batches

2. **PreprocessingActivities**
   - `PreprocessBatch`: Extracts text, chunks documents, detects language

3. **InferenceActivities**
   - `RunInferenceBatch`: Generates embeddings and summaries

4. **PostprocessingActivities**
   - `PostprocessDocuments`: Calculates quality scores, enriches metadata

5. **StorageActivities**
   - `StoreInVectorDB`: Stores embeddings in ChromaDB
   - `StoreInS3`: Stores processed documents in S3/MinIO
   - `StoreMetadata`: Stores pipeline metadata in PostgreSQL

#### Resource-Optimized Activities

1. **CPU-Bound Activities** (run on dedicated CPU workers)
   - `PreprocessText`: Text normalization and cleaning
   - `ValidateDocumentStructure`: Structure validation
   - `ExtractTextFromDocument`: CPU-intensive text extraction
   - `TokenizeText`: Text tokenization and analysis
   - `CompressDocument`: Document compression

2. **GPU-Bound Activities** (run on GPU-accelerated workers)
   - `GenerateEmbeddings`: Vector embeddings using GPU
   - `ClassifyDocument`: Document classification with ML models
   - `PerformOCR`: Optical character recognition
   - `AnalyzeImages`: Image analysis and feature extraction
   - `RunLLMInference`: Large language model inference

3. **IO-Bound Activities** (run on IO-optimized workers)
   - `ParseCSV`: CSV file parsing
   - `DownloadDocument`: Async document downloading
   - `UploadToS3`: S3/MinIO uploads with streaming
   - `QueryMetadataDatabase`: Database queries
   - `StoreVectorEmbeddings`: ChromaDB storage
   - `CallExternalAPI`: External API calls

### Workflow Implementations

#### 1. DocumentPipelineWorkflow
The original workflow orchestrates the entire pipeline:

1. Parses CSV to get document list
2. Processes documents in configurable batches
3. Each batch goes through all pipeline stages
4. Parallel processing within batches
5. Aggregates results and stores metadata

#### 2. ResourceOptimizedWorkflow
The new workflow optimizes resource utilization:

1. **Task Queue Separation**: Routes activities to specialized workers
2. **Resource-Aware Scheduling**: CPU, GPU, and IO tasks run on appropriate workers
3. **Improved Parallelism**: Different resource types process concurrently
4. **Better Resource Utilization**: Prevents resource contention

### Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for efficiency
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent processing using goroutines
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with partial failures
- **Heartbeats**: Long-running activities report progress
- **Retries**: Configurable retry policies for resilience
- **Resource Optimization**: Dedicated workers for CPU, GPU, and IO workloads
- **Task Queue Routing**: Activities execute on appropriate specialized workers

## Performance Tuning

### Worker Configuration

#### Original Worker
Adjust worker settings based on workload:

```go
worker.Options{
    MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize: 10,
    MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize: 10,
}
```

#### Resource-Optimized Workers
Each worker type has optimized configurations:

**CPU Worker**:
- Uses all available CPU cores
- Optimized for CPU-intensive tasks
- Fork-join parallelism

**GPU Worker**:
- Round-robin GPU scheduling
- Configurable GPU count
- Batch processing for efficiency

**IO Worker**:
- High concurrency (200 concurrent activities)
- Optimized for async I/O operations
- Connection pooling

## Monitoring
